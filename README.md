This is a [Zephyr](https://www.zephyrproject.org/)-based firmware for the
[PineTime](https://www.pine64.org/pinetime/) and P8 smartwatches.

## Developer getting started guide

This document assumes that you run a GNU/Linux or Mac operating system.

### Set up the development environment

Follow v2.6 of Zephyr's [Getting Started
Guide](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/2.6.0/getting_started/index.html) up to
but excluding "Build the Blinky Sample" with the following exceptions:

- Get CMake min. v3.13.1 and max. v3.19
- Under "Get the Zephyr source code", run the commands below instead
  of the ones in the guide:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/albsod/pinetime-hypnos
$ cd pinetime-hypnos
$ west init -l app/
$ west update
```

- Under "Download the latest SDK installer", fetch v0.14.2 of the Zephyr toolchain

Finally, run `make tools`.

### Build and flash Hypnos

Run `make` to build everything with the defaults or `make help` to view all the
options and targets.

Then connect your in-circuit programmer and run `make flash`. To install
without a programmer, see Firmware updates below.

### Build and flash the bootloader

To install or upgrade the bootloader, follow Lup Yuen's [build
instructions](https://lupyuen.github.io/pinetime-rust-mynewt/articles/mcuboot#build-and-flash-mcuboot-bootloader)
or [fetch the prebuilt
binary](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-rust-mynewt/releases/tag/v5.0.4).

Then flash it to the beginning of the internal memory:
```
pyocd flash -e sector -t nrf52 bootloader-image.bin
```

## Firmware updates

### SMP over Bluetooth LE

Hypnos supports firmware image management over the Simple Management Protocol.

To make use of this feature, get the
[mcumgr](https://github.com/apache/mynewt-mcumgr#command-line-tool) command-line
tool. Then run the commands below to list, upload, test and confirm firmware
images over BLE:

```
# mcumgr --conntype="ble" --connstring ctlr_name=hci0,peer_name='Hypnos' image list
# mcumgr --conntype="ble" --connstring ctlr_name=hci0,peer_name='Hypnos' image upload hypnos-mcuboot-app-img.bin
# mcumgr --conntype="ble" --connstring ctlr_name=hci0,peer_name='Hypnos' image test <hash of slot-1 image>
# mcumgr --conntype="ble" --connstring ctlr_name=hci0,peer_name='Hypnos' reset
# mcumgr --conntype="ble" --connstring ctlr_name=hci0,peer_name='Hypnos' image confirm
```

If you are unhappy with the new image, simply run the `reset` command again
instead of `image confirm` to revert to the old one. If the image has already
been confirmed but you still want to revert, simply run the commands above but
skip the upload step or perform a manual rollback (see below). [See this
document for more
information](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/samples/subsys/mgmt/mcumgr/smp_svr/README.html).

### DFU over Bluetooth LE

To install Hypnos over the air from
[InfiniTime](https://github.com/JF002/Pinetime), run `make dfu` to create a
(Nordic) DFU package and upload it using
[ota-dfu.py](https://github.com/JF002/Pinetime/tree/master/bootloader/ota-dfu-python)
or nRF Connect.

### Manual rollback

Version 5 of Lup Yuen's bootloader allows you to revert to the old firmware
image by holding the button during boot.
